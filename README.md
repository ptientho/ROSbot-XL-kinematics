# Kinematics Model Design for ROSbot XL Robot

The goal of this checkpoint is to design a kinematics model based on the robot dimensions and transform the model into motion.

## Design Architecture

// show wheel pub node, its topic
// show kinematic model node, its topic
// show how the nodes reated to each other

## Task 1
Develop the holonomic motions of the robot. These motion includes



## Task 2
